        <h4 id="question">How to sign up (as both rider and driver)? </h4>
        <p id="answer">Both riders and drivers will create a profile that is alike. They will enter all necessary information such as name, number, address etc. There is then a verification process in which the person will have to prove their reality to get authenticated.</p>
        <h4 id="question">How can I get paid?</h4>
        <p id="answer">We will calculate the rate of gasoline and factor in the distance that will be travelled. With an account linked, it will be charged after a drive is complete.</p>
        <h4 id="question">How can I get a ride (both as a rider and driver)?</h4>
        <p id="answer"> If you want to be a driver, you just have to select a time frame in which you want to go out of town. To pick a rider(s), a list will show up with the riderâ€™s information such as their reviews and constraints or preferences for the trip. The driver then selects the rider with which they feel most comfortable. Riders just have to put in their preferences of when they want to travel and wait for a rider to select them</p>
        <h4 id="question">Who will I be riding with and what are they like?</h4>
        <p id="answer">As a driver, you will select a rider. You can see what reviews other drivers have left on their account. As a rider you will see which driver selected you and you can confirm if you want the driver based on reviews other riders left on their account.</p>
