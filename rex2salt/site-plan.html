        Our mission
        This is an organized way of doing things. It is more Uber-like in that way. But who wants to pay for an Uber for two three and a half hour rides? Rex2Salt is a sophisticated and organized rideshare platform. As opposed to putting up an announcement in a Facebook group that could be easily missed, a rider can put out a date they want to travel and then a list of drivers that have similar travel plans can pick which rider they want. The riders would pay, and the drivers would get paid through this website rather than just using Venmo or trusting what someone will say. It is a more trustworthy and organized way that wouldn’t be any more expensive for them. 
      
        Why Rex2Salt
        They are looking for a ride from Rexburg to the Salt Lake area (or vice versa). The Facebook page isn’t organized enough and both riders and drivers don’t feel completely assured about their experience. They want an organized sign-up and payment method for both parties that this 3rd party can provide.
      
        How to Get Involved
        They will want to sign up as either a driver or rider. Maybe both. They will create a profile that other users would be able to see. They will then want to plan a trip and find a rider or driver for their trip. After a trip, they will leave a review behind on either the rider or driver (providing a good experience will build that person’s profile and reputation making it easier and more likely to get the ride they want in the future). Pay or get paid.

      <h3>Account Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Where can I start?
        Both the rider’s and driver’s information (name, phone number, pick up address, payment method, etc.) and travel plans are necessary to make anything happen.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        How to sign up (as both rider and driver)? 
        Both riders and drivers will create a profile that is alike. They will enter all necessary information such as name, number, address etc. There is then a verification process in which the person will have to prove their reality to get authenticated. If you want to be a driver, you just have to select a time frame in which you want to go out of town. To pick a rider(s), a list will show up with the rider’s information such as their reviews and constraints or preferences for the trip. The driver then selects the rider with which they feel most comfortable. Riders just have to put in their preferences of when they want to travel and wait for a rider to select them.
      
        How can I get paid? How can I get a ride (both as a rider and driver)? 
        We will calculate the rate of gasoline and factor in the distance that will be travelled. With an account linked, it will be charged after a drive is complete.
      
        Who will I be riding with and what are they like? 
        As a driver, you will select a rider. You can see what reviews other drivers have left on their account. As a rider you will see which driver selected you and you can confirm if you want the driver based on reviews other riders left on their account.
