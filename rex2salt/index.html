            <h4 id="mission-title">Our Mission</h4>
            <p id="mission-content">This is an organized way of doing things. It is more Uber-like 
                in that way. But who wants to pay for an Uber for two three and a half hour rides? 
                Rex2Salt is a sophisticated and organized rideshare platform. As opposed to putting 
                up an announcement in a Facebook group that could be easily missed, a rider can put 
                out a date they want to travel and then a list of drivers that have similar travel 
                plans can pick which rider they want. The riders would pay, and the drivers would get 
                paid through this website rather than just using Venmo or trusting what someone will say. 
                It is a more trustworthy and organized way that wouldn’t be any more expensive for them.</p>

            <h4 id="why-us-title">Why Us</h4>
            <p id="why-us-content">They are looking for a ride from Rexburg to the Salt Lake area 
                (or vice versa). The Facebook page isn’t organized enough and both riders and drivers 
                don’t feel completely assured about their experience. They want an organized sign-up 
                and payment method for both parties that this 3rd party can provide.</p>
